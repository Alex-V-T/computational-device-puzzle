## Puzzle

There is a computational device that has two registers X and Y and can perform only two operations
```
X + Y -> X (operation X)
X + Y -> Y (operation Y)
```
Initial values in registers are 1s (X=1, Y=1).
Given integer number N write a program that finds the shortest sequence of operations to obtain number N in one of the registers.
